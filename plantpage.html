          Urban green spaces are areas where plants and other vegetation grow in
          cities. They can include parks, gardens, street trees, green roofs,
          and community gardens. Urban green spaces provide many benefits for

          stress, anxiety, and depression.
          Studies have shown that spending time in nature can boost mood,
          creativity, and cognitive function. Green spaces can also foster
          social interactions and community cohesion.

          Enhancing physical health by promoting exercise, fresh air, and
          exposure to sunlight. Green spaces can encourage people to walk, bike,
          or play outdoors, which can lower the risk of obesity, diabetes, and
          cardiovascular diseases. They can also provide natural shade and
          cooling, which can prevent heat-related illnesses.

          Supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services by providing habitats
          for plants and animals, and filtering pollutants and carbon dioxide
          from the air. Green spaces can increase the diversity and abundance of
          urban wildlife, such as birds, insects, and mammals. They can also
          improve the quality of water, soil, and air by absorbing rainwater,
          reducing erosion, and producing oxygen.

            Improving air quality by absorbing harmful pollutants and carbon
            dioxide, and releasing oxygen. Some indoor plants, like spider
            plants, peace lilies, and snake plants, are especially effective at
            filtering the air of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are
            emitted by paints, carpets, cleaners, and other sources.

            Reducing stress levels by creating a calming and soothing
            atmosphere. Studies have shown that indoor plants can lower blood
            pressure, heart rate, and cortisol levels, and improve mood and
            cognitive function. They can also enhance your creativity and

            and reducing pain perception. Research has found that patients who
            have plants in their rooms recover faster from surgery, need less
            pain medication, and have fewer complications than those who donâ€™t.
            Plants can also help with minor ailments, such as sunburns, cuts,
            and digestive issues. For example, aloe vera gel can soothe skin
            inflammation, and mint tea can ease stomach discomfort.
